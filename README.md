Something Else:
-----------------------------------------------------
The process of fetching data from the official database can be found in klab's github: https://github.com/KLab/PlaygroundOSS<br>
Here the processed beatmaps from card explorer is used.<br>
Card Explorer is a closed source developed and maintained by NijiharaTsubasa (tsubasa@dash.moe)(https://github.com/NijiharaTsubasa), who also makes a executable version of LLSIF, please do not ask the developer for the source code for fetching data.<br>
.sif is not the original files.<br>
This is originally for personal uses, therefore nobody is allowed to get profit from the code.
It seems that https://c.dash.moe/live has added some "神秘谱面 (Secret (beat)maps)" for LLSIF After School Activity's Challenge difficulties, including (1. 乙女式れんあい塾, 2. PSYCHIC FIRE, 3. ススメ→トゥモロウ, 4. LOVELESS WORLD) (Temporary links: https://c.dash.moe/static/somesecretlive("","2","3","4").html).
